        As every boilerplate, this one has been created to avoid re-doing the same stuff for every

        <ul>
          <li>Setup TypeScript</li>
          <li>Configure Eslint and Prettier</li>
          <li>Install Jest and Testing Library</li>
          <li>Create a Storybook</li>
          <li>...</li>
        </ul>

        own favorite tools.
